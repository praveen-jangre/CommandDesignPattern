# The Command Design Pattern (A Behavioral Design Pattern)
The Command Design Pattern represents a request as an object, enabling separation between the object initiating an operation and the one executing it.

* Represents a request as an object
* Decouples the object that initiates the operation from the one that executes it

## Purpose
* Promotes loose coupling between command invoker and receiver

## Use cases
* Set up an object with commands without changing its code
* Allow queuing or logging of requests
* Add support for undoable operations

## Benefits
* Add new commands without significantly impacting existing code
* Delay or queue request execution
* Provide support for undo/redo operations
* Separates UI elements from the logic they trigger
* It makes it easy to add new commands without substantially altering existing code
* Helpful in adding undo/redo features, queuing operations, and creating macro commands.

## Pitfalls
* Increased number of types
* Memory usage concerns
* Complexity in undo operations
* Increased code complexity
* Performance considerations
* Higher memory footprint

## Implementation Considerations
* More beneficial in larger, complex projects
* Need for undo/redo functionality
* Requirement for action logging
* Need for future extensibility
* Impact on performance
* Increased code complexity
